Team Members:

Zihuang Huang, ZihuangHuang User story: As a student replies on visual aids for better understanding, I need a tool that specifically focuses on presentation and accessibility of information.So I want the program to highlight key concepts within the transcription and summarize the contents in bullet form as a way to help me jot down the notes in case I miss any important info.

Huy Dang, huyxdang User story: As a student, I want the ability to quickly get the main ideas of a lecture before actually diving into it, as well as rapid assessment and feedback on my understanding by quizzes based on the lecture content.
Proposed edit: As a student who’s first language is not English, I struggle when listening to lectures and online videos. Thus, I want a program that is able to transcribe my videos into a written script so that I can read and understand the content better.

Eric Zhang, happycompsci User story: As a student who learns best by testing myself, I want a program that can transform content from my recorded lectures and content videos into quizzes that I can use to test my knowledge. Since I study best with multiple choice quizzes, I want my program to be able to generate as many questions as I need based on a single lecture video.

Ken Tran, kensington21 User story:  As a student who loves to study in groups, I want to create quizzes that I can hand out to everyone based on each lecture that we attend. I am looking for a program that can generate quiz questions based on a recorded lecture or content video, which I can then use to help my study group.
