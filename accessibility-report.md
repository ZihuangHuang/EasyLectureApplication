Overall, our program would be marketed primarily towards students and educators in higher education fields, such as universities and colleges. Students who want to tight up any loose ends can use our tool to obtain concise summaries and get hands-on learning experience by practicing quizzes, helping them study more efficiently. Educators like professors, teaching assisstant or volunteer notetakers from accessibility service can leverage this program to generate supplementary materials, such as summaries and quizzes, to reinforce learning, assess student comprehension and help others with disability in jotting down notes. Additionally, lifelong learners and online course participants who engage with educational videos on platforms like YouTube would benefit from this streamlined content digestion and self-assessment tools that our program has to offer.

While our program is designed to benefit a broad audience, it may be less likely to be used by individuals from certain demographics due to various barriers. Just like the discussion we had in CSC207 embedded ethics module 1, users from lower socioeconomic backgrounds might have limited access to the necessary technology, such as reliable internet connections or compatible devices, hindering their ability to use the program effectively. This is on our end as we failed to take into account the class factor when imagining the range of potential users to our software. This highlights the ethical imperative, as discussed in our embedded ethics modules, to consider inclusivity and strive to minimize barriers that prevent equitable access for all user groups.
